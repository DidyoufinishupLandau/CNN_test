# CNN_test
Using the tensorflow library to achieve CNN. 
We also implement the Alex net. To optimize the running time with large training data, we choose stochastic gradient descent algorithm to calculate the cost function.
The training data used the dog and cat pictures provided by microsoft. See this link https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765.

To see the result, please look at the picture(document in the file with png document name)
